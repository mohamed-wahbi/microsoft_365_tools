# 📘 Technical Documentation Repository

## 📌 Overview  
This repository is dedicated to documenting all the **technical utilities, configurations, and discoveries** that can help us cover any future solution.  

The main objectives are:  
- Ensure **traceability of error handling** and problem resolutions.  
- Document **complex installations** that are not always well explained in official guides.  
- Provide references for **tools, APIs, and techniques** we use across projects.  
- Share **research-based solutions** that required effort and experimentation.  
- Build a **knowledge base** to accelerate future developments.

## 🛠️ Content Covered
- **Error Handling** → Logs, troubleshooting, and fixes for recurring issues.  
- **Environment Setup** → Dependencies installation, configurations, and tips.  
- **API Integrations** → Graph API, authentication flows, and request samples.  
- **Database Models** → MongoDB, SharePoint, and other data sources.  
- **Custom Implementations** → Solutions discovered through research and testing.

## 🎯 Goal
This repo acts as a **technical reference library**:  
- A place to store knowledge.  
- A way to avoid repeating the same research for similar problems in the future.  
- A resource for the team to quickly **discover (AC = discover)** new solutions and best practices.
